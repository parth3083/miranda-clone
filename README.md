I created a dynamic portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JS, drawing inspiration from Miranda's style. Utilising CSS animations gives an elegant touch, while GSAP adds smooth motion to produce a captivating user experience. Locomotive JS powers the fluid navigation, guaranteeing a fluid scroll over the material. This technology fusion improves Miranda's beauty with contemporary interaction while also faithfully replicating it. Subtle animations bring each component to life, creating a visually appealing and flawless user experience. Visit my clone to see how creativity and technology can coexist peacefully while displaying a love for web design and development.
